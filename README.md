# Hotel Management Api

This project was created when I was in the University
the idea to build this app came up after knowing that teachers used just paper and pen to mimc a real hotel management app
so I decided to create a MVP that mimics what a real hotel managament app does
but just for a turism teacher to teach their students a simulation of a real hotel management app
where you can create hotels, rooms, activity rooms, clients, staff.
you can also book a room or an activity room.

## Before you start

Make sure that you do `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed

After that, you can either run the app or test the app with the available scripts explained below

### How do I get set up?

This api uses typeorm to build the DB,
you have to install postgress in your machine and create a local hotel-management database
after that you can just do `npm run start`
it will start listening on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
